# Macros

After reading (Let Over Lambda)[http://letoverlambda.com], I decided to implement its macros in other programming languages.  

## Files

I've kept the all-in-one-file, let-over-lambda.lisp, at the top of the directory as a reference.  In each programming language, I'll be breaking the file apart into smaller parts.  This will make it easier to consume and test on a per-macro basis.

## Languages

A list of languages, and status, I will attempt to port LoL source code, most likely in this order

- Clisp
- Perl6
- JavaScript (w/ sweet.js)
- ClojureScript
- Clojure
- Rust

Ok, so I can already use the source for Clisp. The Clisp project will be folder for writing the first tests for the let-over-lambda.lisp codebase...hopefully I can use some the example source code in the book as unit tests.
